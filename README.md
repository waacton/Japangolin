Japangolin is Japanese conjugation learning aid. It generates a random word/inflection pairing and the user must type the conjugated form.

For example, the pairing of the word `to eat` with the inflection `present · negative · long` expects the answer `たべません` or `食べません`. Hints can be shown by clicking on the word or inflection.
