Installed node.js to get npm (node package manager) installed:
> https://nodejs.org/en/

In command prompt, used npm to install Typings (not the apparently deprecated DefinitelyTyped...)
> npm install typings --global

In command prompt, navigated to Japangolin.Web, used typings to obtain TypeScript definitions:
> typings init
> typings install jquery --ambient --save
> typings install react --ambient --save

* Japangolin.Web/typings folder created (without init command was created in C:\Users\<username>\)
* typings.json file created, populated with jQuery & React
* jQuery intellisense now working in TypeScript files (no /// <reference path="..."> seems to be required)
